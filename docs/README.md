# Cloud 9 Leader-board

## About

Remote work presents many challenges to both teams and individuals. The lack of a stable
working environment with peers often reduces communication between team members, productivity
and motivation. We attempt to address and mitigate some of these common problems for software teams 
specifically with our VSCode extension leader-board. In it we use gamification techniques to help connect
and motivate teammates in a fun and engaging way. 

Built off the Code Time VSCode extention. Cloud 9 Leaderboard is an extention that tracks personal statitics 
of the user based off the different actions performed in VSCode and displays and ranks your own stats versus your 
team on a group leaderboard.   

## Installation
